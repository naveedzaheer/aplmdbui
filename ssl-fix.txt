Solution
As a workaround solution you can fix this by using the legacy provider for openssl. So, you need to edit the package.json file under your applicationâ€™s root directory and check for the following lines and replace them accordingly.

replace "start": "react-scripts start" by "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"
replace "build": "react-scripts build" by "build": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider build"
set the follwing env variable:
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
